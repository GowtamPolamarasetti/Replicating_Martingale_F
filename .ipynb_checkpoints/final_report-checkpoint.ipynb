    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Modern financial regulations require banks and insurance companies to compute risk measures like Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for their complex portfolios. The industry-standard method, **Nested Monte Carlo (NMC)** simulation, is often called the \"brute-force\" approach. While accurate, its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of risk factors and time horizons, making it impractically slow for large, real-world portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Solution\n",
    "This project implements and validates a high-performance alternative based on machine learning, as proposed in contemporary quantitative finance research. The core idea is to replace the costly inner simulation loop of NMC with a fast, accurate proxy model. This proxy, known as a **Replicating Martingale**, is a function that learns to approximate the portfolio's future value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "1.  **Implement** the traditional Nested Monte Carlo simulator as a benchmark.\n",
    "2.  **Build** and **train** an advanced Replicating Martingale model using a neural network basis.\n",
    "3.  **Compare** the models on three key metrics: **accuracy**, **speed**, and the ability to replicate the portfolio's **risk profile**.\n",
    "4.  **Conclude** whether the machine learning approach can match the accuracy of the benchmark while offering a significant computational speedup."

    "## 2. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Instruments\n",
    "The primary instrument under analysis is a **Variable Annuity (VA) with a Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB)**. This is a complex insurance product whose value depends on both financial market performance (modeled by a Geometric Brownian Motion process) and policyholder mortality (modeled stochastically).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Models\n",
    "- **Economic Scenario Generator (ESG):** A multivariate Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process is used to simulate correlated risk factors like equity indices under the risk-neutral measure ($Q$). The price process $S_t$ follows the SDE: $dS_t = rS_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t$, where $r$ is the risk-free rate.\n",
    "- **Lee-Carter Mortality Model:** A standard actuarial model is used to forecast stochastic mortality rates, which are a key driver of the GMDB liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pricing Frameworks\n",
    "- **Nested Monte Carlo:** An outer loop generates $n_0$ scenarios to a future risk horizon (e.g., 1 year). For each outer path, an inner loop generates $n_1$ scenarios to the contract's maturity to price the portfolio. The total cost is proportional to $n_0 \\times n_1$.\n",
    "- **Martingale Pricing & \"Regress-Later\":** The core of the advanced method relies on martingale pricing theory. The value of the portfolio at any time $t$, $V_t$, is the conditional expectation of all future discounted cash flows. The \"regress-later\" approach approximates this by directly regressing the known, noise-free terminal payoff $f(X)$ against the state variables $X_t$ at the risk horizon. This is statistically more stable than regressing on noisy, intermediate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Approach\n",
    "The Replicating Martingale is the function $f_\\theta$ that approximates the conditional expectation. We implemented it as a shallow **Neural Network with a tanh activation function**. The model is trained to minimize the Mean Squared Error between its predictions and the true discounted terminal payoffs from a large training set. To overcome optimization challenges, the input and output data are standardized, and a robust **Adam optimizer** is used to train the network."

    "\n",
    "The following code cell imports all the necessary modules from our project, loads the configuration for the Variable Annuity experiment, trains the `LSMC` and `ReplicatingMartingale` models, and runs the final comparison against the `NestedMC` benchmark.

    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Findings\n",
    "This project successfully implemented a machine learning-based Replicating Martingale framework and validated its performance against traditional methods. The analysis, executed live in this notebook, confirms the key hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final, advanced Replicating Martingale model proved to be a resounding success. The results table and visualization clearly show that it successfully **matched the accuracy and risk profile of the full nested simulation at a fraction of the computational cost**. This confirms the viability of using advanced machine learning techniques to solve computationally intensive problems in quantitative finance and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "The primary limitation of this study is the specificity of the models tested. While the neural network performed well after tuning, its architecture was simple. More complex products might require deeper networks or more sophisticated feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Work\n",
    "This framework serves as a strong foundation for future research. Immediate next steps could include:\n",
    "- **Systematic Hyperparameter Optimization:** Using tools like KerasTuner or Optuna to find the optimal neural network architecture.\n",
    "- **Exploring Other Instruments:** Testing the framework on more exotic derivatives or different types of insurance liabilities.\n",
    "- **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Implementing a pure-TensorFlow version of the polynomial feature generator to properly test the Polynomial-LDR model."
